Therefore, the answer would be: ['Sentiment' : 'Positive']", ['Sentiment' : 'Positive']," The sentence is Neutral as it expresses both a positive experience (enjoyment of removing the cord) and a negative experience (difficulty in replacing it). However, if we focus only on the expressed emotion in each part of the sentence, we can say that the first part is Positive and the second part is Negative.

The first part of the sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards the bendability and the sound. The second part, however, expresses a negative sentiment towards the quality of the material used.

However, if we focus on the sentiment expressed in each part of the sentence, the first part is positive (""it works well"" and ""good protection"") and the second part is negative (""quite expensive"").
