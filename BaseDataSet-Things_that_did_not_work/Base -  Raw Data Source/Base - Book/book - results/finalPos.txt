- "It’s okay."
- "I nodded."
- "You’re a champion."
- "I silently resolved to remember and pray for the four Aron Franks as long as I was around."
- "Our fearlessness shall be our secret weapon."
- "The tales of our exploits will survive as long as the human voice itself."
- "They will remember us."
- "I must say."
- "The kiss lasted forever."
- "Augustus, smiling, bowed."
- "Laughing, I curtsied ever so slightly."
- "I’m okay."
- "God, you are sexy."
- even so I kissed him in that elevator
- “Look, infinite Hazels.”
- “Just out of shape, Hazel Grace. All is well.”
- “Oh, get over yourself,” I said, and took the two steps I needed to get to him. I kissed him, hard, pressing him against the wall.
- as I whispered into his skin, “I love you, Augustus Waters,” his body relaxing beneath mine as he heard me say it.
- “You’re so hot,” I said
- Afterward, when I had my face resting against Augustus’s chest, listening to his heart pound, Augustus said, “Hazel Grace, I literally cannot keep my eyes open.”
- Dearest Augustus,
- The next morning, our last full day in Amsterdam, Mom and Augustus and I walked.
- But even then he was strong
- holding me tight
- so that I could see the sinewy muscles of his arms wrapped around me
- You’ll be okay
- It’ll be okay
- I promise
- He kissed my forehead
- powerful chest deflate just a little
- He kissed me
- we can’t all be as awesome as you
- I like this world
- I like drinking champagne
- I like the sound of Dutch people speaking Dutch
- you’ll keep fighting
- you’ll live your best life today
- If you go to the Rijksmuseum
- I present to you Augustus Waters, whose existential curiosity dwarfed that of his well-fed, well-loved, healthy brethren
- Augustus Waters examined the collection of the Rijksmuseum from afar
- The feeling is mutual
- it is my privilege and my responsibility
- On the flight home, twenty thousand feet above clouds that were ten thousand feet above the ground, Gus said, “I used to think it would be fun to live on a cloud.”
- “Sounds like a nice guy.”
- Gus and I toasted. “To you,” he said.
- “To you,” I said, touching my cup to his.
- Dimmer stars than we’d had at Oranjee, but still good enough to drink.
- “You know,” Gus said to me, “everything Van Houten said was true.”
- Dad smiled. He put a big arm around me and pulled me to him, kissing the side of my head.
- “You are fairly smart,” I said after a while.
- “You are fairly good at compliments,” he answered.
Isaac’s mom brought over two dining room chairs, and Isaac and I sat down next to Gus.
I took Gus’s hand, stroking circles around the space between his thumb and forefinger.
“How’s Monica?” he asked.
“Exactly,” Isaac said.
“I’m good," I said. 
"Excellent," Gus said. 
"Yes!" Gus said. "Yes!"
- My mom: “It’s just delicious.”
- Gus’s mom: “Oh, thanks. I’d be happy to give you the recipe.”
- Me: “Nicely phrased.”
- My dad: “Nicely phrased.”
1. He met me at the door in his wheelchair, no longer the muscular, gorgeous boy who stared at me at Support Group, but still half smiling, still smoking his unlit cigarette, his blue eyes bright and alive.
2. Augustus smiled.
3. Sometimes I dream that I’m writing a memoir. A memoir would be just the thing to keep me in the hearts and memories of my adoring public.
4. "Hazel Grace, when you’re as charming and physically attractive as myself, it’s easy enough to win over people you meet. But getting strangers to love you . . . now, that’s the trick."
5. It is a good life, Hazel Grace.
6. "He was good," I said.
8. How he reveled in saving me.
9. I knelt to kiss him good night.
One morning, a month after returning home from Amsterdam, I drove over to his house.
“You know,” he said after a while, “it’s kids’ stuff, but I always thought my obituary would be in all the newspapers, that I’d have a story worth telling. I always had this secret suspicion that I was special.”
“You are,” I said.
I did know what he meant.
2. Gus’s favorite.
4. Oh, thank God it’s you. Hi. Hi, I love you.
11. Gus, I love you.
13. Stay with me.
- Our beautiful Gussy,” Martha said, leaning in toward him.
- He woke up after a while and the first thing he said was, “Hazel,” which I have to admit made me kind of happy, like maybe I was part of his family, too.
- “Right, it’s primarily his hotness,” I said.
- “Seriously, don’t even get me started on my hot bod."
- “I thank God for you every day, kid.”
- One of the less bullshitty conventions of the cancer kid genre is the Last Good Day convention
- one of the less bullshitty conventions of the cancer kid genre is the Last Good Day convention
- “Good evening, Hazel Grace"
- I love you
- And I you
- It’s fine
- It’s fine
- I can drive
- It’s fine
are the goddamned trophies to break when you need them.
I love you, bro.
I miss you already, bro.
I love you, Augustus. God bless and keep you.
You’ll live forever in our hearts, big man.
You were always such a great friend I’m sorry I didn’t see more of you after you left
Everyone was going to miss him so much.
Everyone was praying for his family.
- “He loved you so much,” Gus’s mom said. “He really did. It wasn’t—it wasn’t puppy love or anything,” she added, as if I didn’t know that.
- “He loved you so much, too,” I said quietly.
- I got up and hugged first his dad and then his mom.
- I grabbed my little clutch and walked up the makeshift aisle between the rows of chairs.
- But he was still Gus. My lanky, beautiful Gus.
- I leaned forward and kissed his cheek. “Okay,” I said. “Okay.”
- Peter Van Houten wore a white linen suit, tailored to account for his rotundity, a powder-blue dress shirt, and a green tie.
- “There’s a great quote in Gus’s house, one that both he and I found very comforting: Without pain, we couldn’t know joy.”
- After his sister Julie spoke, the service ended with a prayer about Gus’s union with God.
- everyone had to come up to me and tell me that I’d spoken beautifully, and that it was a lovely service.
- His pallbearers—cousins, his dad, an uncle, friends I’d never seen—came and got him.
- “Hazel, we have to go for Mr. and Mrs. Waters,” Mom said.
- Van Houten walked up to me and put a fat hand on my shoulder
- My parents introduced themselves
- Then Van Houten nodded the bottle toward me. I grabbed it
- “Hazel,” my mom said
- Thanks for the booze,” I said
- “Have an excellent life.”
- As we drove away, I watched through the back window as he took a drink and raised the bottle in my direction, as if toasting me
- Dad knelt down next to me. He grabbed my head and pulled it into his collarbone
- It was almost like he was angry or something, and I liked that, because I was angry, too
- But it was sure a privilege to love him, huh?
- My old man. He always knew just what to say.
“Gus really loved you, you know,” he said.
- "I miss him."
- "I know."
- "That’s true."
- "But of course, yes, Hazel. Of course you can."
- "No, no, they’re fine."
- "The messages he leaves for us now are coming from above, Hazel."
- "Anyway, I hope that you are doing okay."
- "You’re in our prayers every day, Hazel."
- "It was the only place we’d been together in those last days besides his house."
- "I was really out of breath by the time I settled into a chair next to Isaac."
- "Patrick said a special prayer for me."
- "We promised to live our best life today."
- "I was really smiling."
- "Thank you, Hazel. That means everything to me."
- "This is so great."
- "We like Antonia, the other blonde."
- "Your mom and I love each other."
- "If we lose you, we’ll go through it together."
I’m doing okay.
It was nice to spend time with someone so interesting.
He was always so interesting, you know?
He tried to be like that sometimes, but I liked him best when that stuff fell away.
I love you.
He was such a very charismatic young man.
Mornings were his best time, usually.
I could remember it.
“It so happens that I have just now scheduled a picnic with your father in Holliday Park.”
She never stopped trying, my mom.
- It was kind of a beautiful day
- real summer in Indianapolis, warm and humid
- reminds you after a long winter
- we were built for the world
- “What a day"
- Van Houten would like the Ruins, Gus, too
- we sat in the shadow of the Ruins and ate a little lunch
- I'm okay
- the wind in the leaves
- kids figuring out how to be alive
- how to navigate a world
- playground that was
- You miss running around like that
- Sometimes, I guess
- I was just trying to notice everything
- elegant universe in ceaseless motion
- What a day
- May God bless and keep you, Hazel
- I'm a good person
- good writer
- a good team
- I want to leave a mark
- marking everything MINE
- Hazel is different
- She walks lightly upon the earth
- it's not sad, Van Houten. It's triumphant. It's heroic
- the real heroes are the people NOTICING things, paying attention
- She is so beautiful
- You don't get tired of looking at her
- She is funny without ever being mean
- I love her
- I am so lucky to love her, Van Houten
- I hope she likes hers
- I do, Augustus
- I do
